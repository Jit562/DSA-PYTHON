what is DSA?.

ans :- Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Two type of DSA.

1. Linear DSA.
2. Nonlenear DSA

Linear DSA:- (
    1. Array
    2. Stack ( LIFO )
    3. Queue ( FIFO )
    4. Linked List
)

Nonlenear DSA :- (
    1. Graph
    2. Tree
)


Why Data Structure?

Knowledge about data structures help you understand the working of each data structure. And, based on that you can select the right data structures for your project.


Linear Vs Non-linear Data Structures

Linear :- The data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other.

Non-Linear :- The data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner).

Linear :-  All the items are present on the single layer.

Non-Linear :- The data items are present at different layers.

Linear :-It can be traversed on a single run. That is, if we start from the first element, we can traverse all the elements sequentially in a single pass.

Non-Linear :- It requires multiple runs. That is, if we start from the first element it might not be possible to traverse all the elements in a single pass.

Linear :- The memory utilization is not efficient.

Non-Linear :- Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need.

Linear :- The time complexity increase with the data size.

Non-Linear :-  Time complexity remains the same.
Linear :- Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue
Non-Linear :-  Example: Tree, Graph, Map
