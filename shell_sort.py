'''
Shell sort is a generalized version of the insertion sort algorithm. It first sorts elements that are far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted.

# Shell sort in python


def shellSort(array, n):

    # Rearrange elements at each n/2, n/4, n/8, ... intervals
    interval = n // 2
    while interval > 0:
        for i in range(interval, n):
            temp = array[i]
            j = i
            while j >= interval and array[j - interval] > temp:
                array[j] = array[j - interval]
                j -= interval

            array[j] = temp
        interval //= 2
